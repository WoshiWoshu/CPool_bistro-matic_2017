# CPool_bistro-matic_2017
First year project in C in which the goal is to write a program that will display the result of an evaluated mathematical expression (kind of a big calculator). The expression will be composed of infinite integers that can be expressed in any base. The program handle following operators: +-*/%, parentheses, operation priorities and syntax errors, but not float numbers.
